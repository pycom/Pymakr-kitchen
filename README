Must clone the Pymakr repo in a directory called src. Then go to the linux or the mac directory, and run the scripts.
Remember that the Windows and Linux versions need their version to be written by hand:

Windows: inside the iss script
Linux: build_files/debian/changelog

For Windows:
	1. Install python 2.7 as "for this user only". Remove things like documentation (keep pip, see bellow)
	2. Install PyQt. Remove unneded things
	3. Install pySerial
	4. On the source code directory, compile the Ui with: python compileUiFiles.py
	5. Run the program at least once: python pymakr.py
	6. Create the installer
